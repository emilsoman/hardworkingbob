# HardworkingBob

A hardworking guy who listens to whatever the heck you say on skype

This was a fork of [basil](https://github.com/pbrisbin/basil) , but then I wanted the plugin framework to change,
and I wanted to remove some default email sending stuff from the bot's code.

## Getting started

~~~ { .bash }
git clone https://github.com/emilsoman/hardworkingbob.git
cd hardworkingbob
cp config/example.yml config/config.yml
bundle install
bundle exec bin/hardworkingbob
~~~
